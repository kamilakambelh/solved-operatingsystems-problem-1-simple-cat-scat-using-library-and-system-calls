Write a program scat (simple cat or slow cat) that copies data from the standard input to the standard output.

<ol>

 <li>Implement the data copying loop using the C library functions getc()/putc() and using the system calls read()/write() operating on a single byte at a time. Your scat program should accept the command line options -l and -s: The option -l selects the C library copy loop (using getc()/putc()) and the option -s selects the system call copy loop, using one byte at a time read()/write() system calls. In case there are multiple options on the command line, the last option wins. If there is neither a -l nor a -s option, the program uses the C library functions copy loop.</li>

 <li>Use your scat program to copy a large file to /dev/null (a device file that discards all data) and measure the execution times:</li>

</ol>

time ./scat -l &lt; some-large-file &gt; /dev/null time ./scat -s &lt; some-large-file &gt; /dev/null

Repeat the measurements a few times to get stable results. What do you observe? Explain. Use strace to investigate the read/write sizes that are used by the two variants of your program. How many read/write calls in total are executed while copying your large file?

<ol>

 <li>Extend your program by implementing another option -p and a copy loop that uses the Linux specific sendfile() system call. Set the amount of data that is copied in each call of sendfile() such that it matches the number of bytes read and written by the C library. Measure the execution time.</li>

</ol>

time ./scat -p &lt; some-large-file &gt; /dev/null What do you observe? Explain.

Hand in the source code of your scat program and the results of your analysis. Make sure that your program handles <em>all </em>error situations appropriately. Use the getopt() function of the C library for the command line option parsing.

<strong>Problem 1.2: </strong><em>watch â€“ execute a program periodically                                                                  </em>

Write a C program called watch that executes a command periodically (e.g., every 2 seconds), showing the output on the standard output (terminal). Your implementation of watch does not have to clear the screen like other implementations of watch do. Your program should implement a command line option -n to set the number of seconds that watch sleeps between each repeated execution of the command. The option -b causes the special value

a to be written to the standard output if an execution of the command ends with a non-zero exit code (this usually rings the terminal bell). The option -e terminates your watch program when the execution of a command fails. (If -e is not given on the command line, the execution continues irrespective of any failures of the command execution.)

Your program must use the fork(), execvp(), and waitpid() system calls. You are not allowed to use the system() library call. You can let your watch program sleep by calling the sleep() library function.

$ ./watch -e ls -l /foo ls: /foo: No such file or directory $

Make sure your program properly handles all possible runtime errors and that it returns an error status to its parent process (usually the shell) in case a runtime error occured.

Use the getopt() function of the C library for the command line option parsing.
